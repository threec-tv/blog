Hey,

The stack consists of multiple Java microservices which control the channels, payments and third party connectors.
A NodeJs app which controls all things chat. 
A few lambda functions which controls emails.
And finally the UI, made in NuxtJs with Vuetify UI components.

The transcoding is done by OvenMediaEngine and playback via Video.Js or a modified OvenPlayer.

The database is a single sharded MongoDb instance.

All hosted on AWS ECS and ready to scale out.

Contact me if you want a more in depth break down

Thanks

Adam
