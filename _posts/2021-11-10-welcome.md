Hello and Welcome
---


Hey,


Welcome to threeC.tv first blog post.


This is going to be the start of a journey. Are we going to make it? I hope so and I hope you can be around for the journey.


The platform is growing steadily and I hope it turns into something good and a friendly place for people to stream and build their own community and join the community as a whole.


If people are interested I'll be posting tech stuff here.


But check out the site and see you on Discord.


Thanks


Adam
